Introduction
============

**PORGY** is an interactive visual environment, based on `Tulip <http://tulip.labri.fr>`_, for modelling complex systems through graphs and graph rewriting rules.
Graph rewriting systems appear as a powerful formalism to capture and study phenomena occurring in complex systems, such as the evolution of bio-molecular networks, adhoc communication networks or interaction nets.
